# Used Car Prediction (Predictive Analytics - May 2024)

This project focuses on predicting used car prices using a dataset of 10,000 cars. Through comprehensive data preparation and predictive modeling techniques, the project aims to provide insights into the factors that influence car prices.

## Project Overview

**Brief:** The goal of this project was to develop accurate predictive models for estimating the prices of used cars. The analysis includes data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the evaluation of various machine learning algorithms to determine the best approach for predicting car prices.
**Programming Language:** R Programming
**Database Software:** R Studio

## Key Features

- **Dataset**: 
  - Utilized a dataset containing 10,000 records of used cars, including features such as make, model, year, mileage, and condition.

- **Data Preparation**:
  - Conducted thorough data cleaning and preprocessing to enhance data quality.
  - Performed exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and relationships between features.

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Created new features from existing data to improve model performance.
  - Handled categorical variables through encoding techniques.

- **Predictive Modeling**:
  - Developed and evaluated multiple predictive models, including:
    - **Linear Regression**
    - **Random Forest**
    - **Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)**
    - **Decision Trees**
    - **Bagging**
  - Assessed model performance using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
